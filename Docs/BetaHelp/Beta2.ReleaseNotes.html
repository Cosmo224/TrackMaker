				<br><br>
				<b>Issues fixed since Beta1:</b><br>
				<ul>
					 
					<li>The Save Current Project button now defaults to TProj2 format.</li>
					<li>Previews and the "Season Start Time" display are now implemented!</li>
					<li>Some "duplicate layer" bugs.</li>
					<li>Fixed the Import/Export button being cut off on some import/export windows.</li>
					<li>Improved ATCF export functionality, the coordinates output make somewhat more sense.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<b>Other Changes Since Beta1:</b><br>
				
				<ul>
					<li>The "Open" button is back to "Import" again, I think it reads better considering its child menu options.
					<li>Removed most beta branding
				</ul>
				
				<h5><i>Known Issues (don't report these):</i></h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Using the zoom controls while panning will reset the screen position to the top-left corner (working on this).</li>
					<li>You can't enable and disable a layer if it's not the selected layer.</li>
					<li>The Help button doesn't work. This is because there is no help yet.</li>
					<li>HURDAT2-format importing is not currently implemented.</li>
					<li>Some of the text is cut off.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h5><i>Q & A</i></h5>
				
				Q: The Track Maker crashed or displayed an unexpected error or fatal error message!<br><br>
				A: In the directory you opened the Track Maker, there should be a "Priscilla-Log-*.txt" file created each time you launch the Track Maker.<br>
				Find the most recent one and either send it to me with a description of the issue or file as an issue on GitHub (at https://github.com/Cosmo224/TrackMaker) WITH THE LOG FILE ATTACHED! Otherwise I will not be able to debug it.
				<br><br>
				Q: I want to request a feature!<br><br>
				A: DM me on Discord (Starfrost#9088) or file an issue on GitHub and I will consider it.
				<br><br>
				Q: I found a bug not listed above!</br><br>
				A: DM me on Discord with details of the bug and your most recent Priscilla-Log-*.txt file; alternatively, file an issue on GitHub WITH THE MOST RECENT LOG ATTACHED!
				<br><br>
				Q: I want to launch the ACE Calculator or Advisory Generator individually without launching the Track Maker first!<br><br>
				A: You can.
				Run the Track Maker with the command-line argument <pre>-initacecalc</pre> to start the ACE Calculator, <br>and <pre>-initadvgen</pre> to start the Advisory Generator. <br><br>There will be shortcuts for this created by the installer in the final version.
				<br><br>
				Q: What does Priscilla mean? I see it everywhere!<br><br>
				A: It was the codename for Track Maker 2.0, back when I wasn't sure if it was version 1.5 or 2.0. If you're interested, the next version after 2.0 is codenamed <i>Iris.</i>
				<br><br>
				<b>If you have any other questions, please send me a DM on Discord (Starfrost#9088). Have fun! Your feedback is vital to the success of this project!</b>
