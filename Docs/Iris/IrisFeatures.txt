Priority:
1		Must have
2		Should have
3		Nice to have
4		Not required

==Priority 1 / 2==
1. InstaPlace Mode
Iris will have a setting that allows adding track points to be similar to Monsoon's Hypo TC Track Maker and the Legacy Track Maker; this will be accomplished by a global place mode setting. When InstaPlace is on, categories will be controlled by keys; these keys will be dynamically generated from the first letter of the second word of the category name - or in the case of the category name only having one word - the first word.

2. Temporary File Management
Iris will have APIs for temporary file management. These will be used for the new ATCF importer (ATCF2Tproj) and
