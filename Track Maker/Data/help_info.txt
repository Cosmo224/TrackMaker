==Release Notes==
v2.0.1 (11 January 2021):
This is a bugfix release and fixes several issues identified since the release of Track Maker 2.0, improving your experience.

- An issue resulting in tracks imported from ATCF/HURDAT2 data files having the wrong positions has been fixed.
- The bottom text on the about screen has been fixed to display the proper text instead of the text used for pre-release builds.
- Fullscreen mode has been fixed and looks less weird
- Default window style (fullscreen / windowed) setting now works 
properly. It isn't on the ApplicationSettings menu yet, but it will be in a future release (I just wanted to get this out quickly)
- Fixed an issue with the first fullscreen mode change not working properly.  
- A minor cosmetic issue has been fixed with the ACE calculator.
- Additional error handling for the updater to prevent a nasty crash if the server is up but doesn't send a proper response.
